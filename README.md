Machine learning(ML), is a branch of artificial intelligence and computer science. When there is no equation that describes a problem , it actually learns from data. By providing the dataset to the ML algorithm, it begins to build the model that it will be used for rather than to conclude the equation that will predict the output.This essay begins by defining the ML concept especially in the field of bioinformatics .It then explores the application of ML in biology.Subsequently, it describes the phases of ML modeling.

### **Introduction to machine learning** 
Machine learning is the ability to use computers to solve problems, by learning from historical data to predict the desired output that will help later in enhancing the decision making.  In the field of bioinformatics, machine learning can help by building models that can be used to detect patterns within biological inputs like genomes, health-care data etc. ML trains from these biological data and make predictions
ML techniques are applied in two main biological domains:(1) omics science and (2) systems biology . It can be applied analyzing biological data from various areas like: predicting the gene locations and their biological roles , predicting protein or molecular functions and studying the interactions between them .also, predicting diseases from molecular samples and more and more.

Figure1: shows the application of machine learning in biology.

### **Phases of machine learning and its concept**
ML has two major phases which is training and testing the model. That is used to answer biological questions . In the training phase, the ML model begins to train in the training data the model has, it is important so that the model can make predictions . Then followed by a testing phase where the testing data is used to evaluate the performance of the model and make predictions.

ML has main categories are listed as follows:
Supervised learning: this class mainly depends on predefined input-labels, and the model begins to find the correlation between the input data and target output which is the target. This class has two types :(1) classification and the commonly classification algorithms are :Decision trees, Random forests, Support vector machines, Neural Networks, Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes. (2) regression and its algorithm include:linear or multivariate regression logistic regression with lasso, ridge, or elastic-net penalties.
Unsupervised learning : where the machine trains with input data or labels only, and the output is unknown , and tries to detect patterns. The algorithm which is used in unsupervised learning is clustering algorithm , where the data points with the same properties are classified together to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.
Semi-Supervised learning : here the dataset is mixed between labeled and unlabeled data, and it is also known as inductive learning.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, ML techniques and tools are very useful in the bioinformatics era. Begin by training the model arriving to make predictions and make investigations .These powerful technologies have opened up new possibilities for understanding and manipulating biological systems as it grows exponentially over time.
